= Installation =

Installation is following best practices in prestashop, so
  * Download .zip file
  * Unzip to <..your-prestashop-folder../modules/>.
  * Install plugin in your modules admin section, is in "seo" tab.
  * Provide your facebook id (so this e-shop is managed by you)
  * Add "og" xml namespace to your template header.tpl <html xmlns:og="http://ogp.me/ns#" xmlns:fb="http://www.facebook.com/2008/fbml">


= Debugging =

Hardedst thing was get product_id and image_id, this was done by current lang_id. 

   * If you are using more languages, so lang_id is present in HTTP GET (or cookies) and everyting works well. 
   * If you are not using multiple languages and you force language in admin (as me in first project), you *MUST* hardcode your lang_id in hookHeader function.
